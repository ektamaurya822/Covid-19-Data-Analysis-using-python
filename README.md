# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-using-python
A COVID-19 Data Analysis involves cleaning and processing data to explore key metrics like cases, deaths, and recoveries. It includes identifying trends, analyzing geographical patterns, and using visualizations like charts and graphs. This helps in understanding the virus's spread and making informed decisions.
Hello and welcome to my COVID-19 data analysis project using Python.

Introduction
In this project, I will be conducting an analysis of COVID-19 data to explore its relationship with the happiness of residents in different countries.

Purpose of the Analysis
As a data enthusiast, I am interested in understanding if there is any correlation between the spread of the coronavirus in a country and the happiness of its residents.

Datasets
For this analysis, I will be working with two main datasets:

COVID-19 Dataset: This dataset, published by Johns Hopkins University, contains cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in different countries.
World Happiness Report Dataset: Published annually by the United Nations, this dataset contains scores given by residents of different countries for various life factors.
Prerequisites
To successfully complete this analysis, I have ensured that I am equipped with the necessary skills and tools:

Proficiency in the Python programming language.
Experience working with Jupyter Notebook.
Knowledge of Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Any unfamiliar methods or functions will be explained as I progress through the analysis.
Getting Started
To follow along with this project, you can clone or download the repository to your local machine. You will find the Jupyter Notebook file, as well as the datasets required for the analysis.

Feel free to join me on this journey as we explore the fascinating intersection of COVID-19 data and human happiness.

Happy analyzing!
